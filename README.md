## Regression on Time Series

### `Regression_onTimeseries.ipynb`

This notebook explores regression analysis on time series data, covering key aspects such as:

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Importing the dataset, handling missing values, ensuring stationarity, and creating training/testing splits.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Generating lag features, rolling statistics, and time-based variables to enhance predictive performance.  
- **Model Selection & Training**: Implementing and tuning regression models like Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression for time series forecasting.  
- **Evaluation & Insights**: Assessing model performance using MAE, MSE, and R-squared, visualizing results, and deriving key insights.  
- **Advanced Techniques & Future Work**: Exploring ARIMA, Prophet, or other time series models, discussing limitations, and potential improvements.  

This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to applying regression techniques on time series data, bridging theory with practical implementation.
